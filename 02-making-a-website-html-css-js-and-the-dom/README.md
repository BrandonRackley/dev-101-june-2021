# Day 2: Making a Website: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the DOM

## Keyboard 2

## Define outcomes and validate

-   Ask:
    -   What do I want to accomplish?
    -   How will I know I've accomplished it?
-   Break the outcome into parts:
    -   Is this the smallest possible outcome? If not, what is?
    -   How will I know I've accomplished it?

## Food for Thought

-   [User Research](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/cards-component/)

## The DOM

## Handling Events

## Upgrade the nametag!

Planning it out:

1. HTML setup
1. Grab the dom elements (the input box and the button) in
1. Add an event listener to the button
1. Get access to user's input
1. Use the user's input to "do something".
1. Display the result to the user

(You'll get an email error about tests--don't worry about it for today!)
Note: This puts the css in a separate directory!

## Exercises
