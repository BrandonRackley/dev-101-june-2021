## Terminal Commands and Github Lab

1) Create a repo with a README.md on Github:
    ```
    lab-01b-terminal-and-markdown-in-github
    ```
1) `pwd` to make sure you're in the right directory
1) Clone your repo on the command line
1) `cd` into your repo from the command line
1) `pwd` to make sure you're in the right directory
1) Open the project in VSCode by typing `code .` in that directory.
1) Using either VSCode, or from the command line, once you're in your repo, create a file tree that looks like this:
    ```
    <repo name>
        |__ src
            |__ assets
                |__ style.css
                |__ app.js
            |__ index.html
        |__ README.md
        |__ greeting.md
    ```

1) **ACP your code and push it to your main branch!**
1) In README.md, also add (random, arbitrary) examples of a bullet list, a table, bold, italicized, h1, h2, and h3 text.
1) **ACP your code (again!) and push it to your main branch (again)!**
1) Put the link to the repo in the canvas submission.
